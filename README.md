React Challenge: Hot Or Cold

In the Hot or Cold guessing game, the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player then tries to guess the number. The player gets feedback for each guess â€“ "hot" if their guess was close, and "cold" if their guess was far. When the user guesses the secret number, the app lets them know, and they'll have the option to start a new game.



Requirements:
X  Create a new local React project using Create React App.

X  Begin by breaking the UI into separate sections, and creating static, stateless components for each piece.

X  You should be able to see a complete static version of your user interface before working on the interactivity.

__  Add state to your components where necessary to store   information about the current progress through the game.
    You might want to think about storing some or all of the following:
__      The current number which the user is trying to guess.
__      The user's most recent guess.
__      A history of the user's guesses.
__      The feedback currently being displayed to the user.
__      The different options for feedback that the user can be given.

__  Add interactivity so your components respond to the user making a guess, and update the state accordingly.



Components:
  guess-form
  guess-section
  guess-count
  guess-list
  feedback
  status-section
